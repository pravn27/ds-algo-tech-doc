## DSA Interview guidance

- Steps to follow once get DSA problems
  - Understand problem statement completely with inputs, outputs
  - Try with sample inputs / outputs
  - Identify the pattern and Thought process to solve
  - Dry run with sample inputs, outputs along with your pseudo code
  - Implement / write code
  - Make sure think about all Edge / Corner cases covered
  - Good to ask with Interviewer for what all edge case to cover

## DSA problems Edge / Corner cases

- Array based problems
  - What if Array is Empty ?
  - What if Array has negative numbers ?
  - What if Array has Duplicates numbers ?
  - What if Array has Infinity numbers ?
