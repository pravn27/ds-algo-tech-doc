## DSA Interview guidance

- Steps to follow once get DSA problems
  - Understand the problem statement completely with inputs, outputs
    - Try with sample inputs / outputs
  - Thought Process & Approach
    - Identify the Pattern and Thought process to solve
  - Pseudo Code
    - Dry run with sample inputs, outputs along with your pseudo code
  - Implementation
    - write a actual code & execute
    - use comments to break the your steps / approach to problems
  - Improve & Refactor
    - Time & Space complexity analysis
  - Make sure think about all Edge / Corner cases covered
  - Good to ask with Interviewer for what all edge case to cover

## DSA problems Edge / Corner cases

- Array based problems
  - What if Array is Empty ?
  - What if Array has negative numbers ?
  - What if Array has Duplicates numbers ?
  - What if Array has Infinity numbers ?
- Numbers based problems
  - What if number is
    - 0
    - negative
    - decimal
