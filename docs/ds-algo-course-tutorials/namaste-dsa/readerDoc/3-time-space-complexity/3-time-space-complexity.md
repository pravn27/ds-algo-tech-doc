# 3 - Time & Space Complexity

> This episode introduces Big O notation, helping you understand how code performance scales with input size. A must-watch for preparing DSA interviews.

## Time Complexity

- **`Time complexity is used to measure efficiency of Algorithm in terms of speed, as the input size grows.`**
  - Speed Efficiency ---> When input size grows
- What is Algorithm ?
  - Step by step solution to the problem statement
- `Time Complexity is not equal to Time taken by algorithm`
  - Time complexity != time taken
  - Time taken by algorithm vary from machine to machine
- Time complexity understanding with example for efficiency

- What is Efficient algorithm ?
  - As input size grows / increases, how your algorithm behaves Efficiently ?
- Time complexity comparison as input size grows

  - https://github.com/pravn27/ds-algo-coding-challenge/blob/master/namaste-dsa/ref-img/time-complexity/tc-compare1.2.png
  - Based on above examples, Binary search is much better than Linear search in terms of efficiency as input size increases

## How to represent Time Complexity ?

    - **Big O Notation**
    - Measure Time complexity in Worst case
