# 1 - Introduction

## Introduction

- Process of DSA, solved in 2 step process

  - Once understand the problems
    - what is the `Thought process & Approaching` to the problems in certain way and `finding the solution to problem`
    - Optimize the solution, time & space complexity
  - Coding / Implementation
    - Once solution is ready, then go with Code / Implementation

- when ever solving DSA problems, never start with coding, its worst way of solving problem

- Don't just study DSA only for Interview !!
  - Never take shortcut to study DSA
  - Never focus on Interview
- Focus only on understanding DSA, approach, solution to the problems

- How much time it takes to study DSA ?

  - Don't hurry, take your time to understand DSA
  - At least 3 - 5 months for fair expectation
  - its long journey

- Follow the curriculum in the order present in course

- Make your own motes, write & practice your own code

- Understanding DSA, it takes time !!

- Spaced repetition & Random Questions

  - Focus on thought process, approach to the problems

- Join the community & help each other

- Make a habit of daily solving DSA problem at least once a day, at least one problem / day

## Which language ?

- DSA is language agnostic

  - DSA does not care about which language you use to solve it ?
  - DSA can solve with any programming language

- Language using Javascript & Python
