## Introduction

  - [Big O Slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/big-o-notation)

- What is Big O Notation?
  - Big O Notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, specifically their time and space complexity. It provides an upper bound / worst-case scenario on the growth rate of an algorithm's resource consumption as the input size increases.
  - Its numerical representation of performance of your code / algorithm
  - Big O Notation helps developers understand the scalability of their code and make informed decisions about algorithm optimization.

## Timing our Code

- What metrics using for Big O Notation ?
  - Time Complexity (preferred)
  - Space Complexity
- **With Time Complexity, will not go with measuring time taken to run the code, instead we focus on the Number of Operations performed as the input size grows.**

- How to measure Time Complexity?

  - Count the number of simple Operations the computer has to perform.
  - We can measure Time Complexity by analyzing the algorithm and counting the number of basic operations it performs as a function of the input size.
  - This can often be done using "Big O" notation, which provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency.
