- What is Big O Notation?
  - Big O Notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, specifically their time and space complexity. It provides an upper bound / worst-case scenario on the growth rate of an algorithm's resource consumption as the input size increases.
  - Its numerical representation of performance of your code / algorithm
  - Big O Notation helps developers understand the scalability of their code and make informed decisions about algorithm optimization.
